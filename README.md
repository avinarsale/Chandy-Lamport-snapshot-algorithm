# Chandy-Lamport-snapshot-algorithm

Implemented a distributed banking application using the Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm along with Googleâ€™s protocol buffer for marshalling-unmarshalling messages and TCP sockets for sending-receiving messages in C++. The distributed bank has multiple branches and very branch knows about all other branches. Application allows to take snapshot at any given time.
